# CoursePlanner
College Course Planner that reads from a CSV.

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
      The problem was having an organized view of courses within a Computer Science Degree Program. 
      It was both being able to view individual courses and the entire course structure.
      
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
      I used a Binary Search Tree to solve the problem. Since each node in the structure had only two pre-requisite courses that was how I organized the BST to be made. 
      The data structure being used made the accessing of node/courses much faster.
      
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
      I created a separate project called 'Working with Files' and 'BinSearch'. 
      The working with files was my attempt at working with a txt file and a CSV file to overcome my issues with reading and writing to the two types of files. 
      The 'BinSearch' project was used to work with a BinarySearchTree's search function so that I could better understand how to create the tree and interact with it in a search function.
      
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
      It made storage of data much easier to understand and the reason behind creating a structure in the first place.
      I had worked previously with some structures but didn't understand the why so now I know that they're invaluable to efficiency.
      
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      I worked heavily on documenting my code and making it more readable. 
      I started to add in more comments and ensure that the comments were concise.
      I also made the code relatively adaptable, many of the function designs became less specific and more general.
      The general functions are easier to copy and paste and modify to the next time I need a similar function.
